        <p>
         Hey! I’m a vibe coder who’s all about building slick, scalable apps and pushing the boundaries of what tech can do. Always on the hunt for new challenges, fresh collabs, or just some good old-fashioned business and banter. Whether it’s hacking through code, brainstorming wild ideas, or diving deep into machine learning magic—I’m here, ready to grind, grow, and glow. Let’s build something dope together, vibe high, and make waves. Adventure? Collaboration? Hustle? Count me in—I’m all about that energy.
        </p>
